                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Maria Tecla Artemisia Montessori (Italian pronunciation: [maˈriːa montesˈsɔːri];
                     August 31, 1870 – May 6, 1952) was an Italian physician and educator best known
                     for the philosophy of education that bears her name, and her writing on scientific pedagogy. 
                     At an early age, Montessori broke gender barriers and expectations when she enrolled 
                     in classes at an all-boys technical school, with hopes of becoming an engineer.
                     She soon had a change of heart and began medical school at the University of Rome, 
                     where she graduated – with honors – in 1896. Her educational method is still in use
                    today in many public and private schools throughout the world.

                    <h2>Montesory Method</h2>
                    <p>One of Montessori's many accomplishments was the Montessori method.
                    This is a method of education for young children that stresses the development
                    of a child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. 
                    This method allowed children to develop at their own pace and provided educators 
                     with a new understanding of child development. Montessori's book, The Montessori Method,
                    presents the method in detail. Educators who followed this model set up special environments
                    to meet the needs of students in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years,
                    2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration,
                     manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children
                     in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their 
                    immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on
                     their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity</p>
